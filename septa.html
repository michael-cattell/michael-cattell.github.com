                <p><strong>client: </strong>personal project</p>
                <p><strong>description: </strong>this map shows the dramatic cut back of regional rail in southeastern pennsylvania since the southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority (SEPTA) took over rail operations in the region in the 1970s. this is due to several overlapping financial, ridership, and political factors that resulted in several communities losing access to philadelphia and surrounding communities via rail. this map was submitted to the student map competition at the north american cartographic information society (NACIS) 2025 conference.</p>
